# CASE Conversion Examples

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)
![CASE Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/CASE%20Version-1.2.0-brightgreen.svg)

This repository provides example scripts for extracting information from CASE graphs and writing them to various output formats. This project contains several directories with the same general intent, but different implementations/languages. The directories are as follows:

- `dotnet` - C# implementation using the dotNetRDF library
- `java` - Java implementation using the Apache Jena library
- `python` - Python implementation using the RDFLib library

Each directory contains the code to convert a CASE graph to a specific output format after storing them in intermediary types. The general process is:

1. Read the contents of the JSON-LD graph into an in-memory graph datastore in the selected library (e.g. `dotNetRDF`)
1. Query properties from the datastore using a SPARQL query and store each record into a custom `GeoRecord` object
1. Convert the list of `GeoRecord` objects into a `.geojson` file

The input and output files are specified as command line arguments. The input file should be a CASE graph in JSON-LD format. The output file will be written to a GeoJSON file.

These implementations are not production ready and do not properly handle all exceptional states nor do they contain proper logging, documentation, or automated tests. They are intended to be used as a starting point for a more robust solution. They also do not represent the only way to convert a CASE graph to a GeoJSON file. They are intended to highlight the value of utilizing the CASE Ontology to create a graph that can be used to query and generate data in a variety of formats, regardless of the source application's data model.

Each directory contains a `README.md` with more information about the specific implementation as well as specific usage but the general usage expects the following two positional arguments:

| Argument | Description                                                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| input    | The input file containing the CASE graph in JSON-LD format |
| output   | The output file into which to write the GeoJSON file       |
